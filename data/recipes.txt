Recipe: Tropical Coconut Pineapple Potato Salad

Ingredients:
- 2 large potatoes
- 1 cup freshly grated coconut
- 1 cup diced pineapple
- 1/2 cup red bell pepper, diced
- 1/4 cup red onion, finely chopped
- 1/4 cup cilantro leaves, chopped
- 1/4 cup unsalted macadamia nuts, roughly chopped
- Juice of 1 lime
- 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste

Instructions:

1. Start by cooking the potatoes. Wash them thoroughly and leave the skin on for added texture. Place the potatoes in a large pot, cover them with water, and add a pinch of salt. Bring the water to a boil over high heat and cook the potatoes until they are tender, about 15-20 minutes. Test for doneness by inserting a knife or fork into the center of a potato; it should go through smoothly. Once cooked, remove from heat, drain, and let them cool before proceeding.

2. While the potatoes are cooling, prepare the dressing. In a small bowl, combine the lime juice, olive oil, salt, and pepper. Whisk together until well combined. Set aside.

3. Once the potatoes are cool enough to handle, cut them into bite-sized pieces and transfer them to a large mixing bowl.

4. Add the freshly grated coconut, diced pineapple, red bell pepper, red onion, and cilantro to the bowl with the potatoes.

5. Pour the prepared dressing over the salad ingredients and gently toss until everything is well coated. Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary.

6. Lastly, sprinkle the chopped macadamia nuts on top of the salad for some added crunch and texture.

7. Serve immediately and enjoy this Tropical Coconut Pineapple Potato Salad as a delicious side dish for your next outdoor gathering or as a standalone lunch option. The flavors of coconut and pineapple combined with the creamy potatoes create a refreshing and tropical experience!

Note: If you prefer a chilled potato salad, refrigerate the cooked potatoes and coconut for at least 1 hour before adding the other ingredients and dressing.
